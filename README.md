# awaystays
AwayStays is a football-first accommodation platform built for travelling supporters. We turn city-centre rooms in Liverpool into matchday bases — complete with pub routes, buses to Anfield, post-match return plans, food spots, nightlife, and quiet alternatives if you want them. You stay where the atmosphere is. We handle the rest.
